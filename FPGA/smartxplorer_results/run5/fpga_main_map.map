Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           250 out of   1,920   13%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               466 out of   1,920   24%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            370 out of     960   38%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     370 out of     370 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     370   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         622 out of   1,920   32%
    Number used as logic:               466
    Number used as a route-thru:        156

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 33 out of     108   30%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.68

Peak Memory Usage:  286 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  10 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   9 secs
